      { "text": "Collabyrinth is a multiplayer maze exporation game focusing on collaboration to escape a randomly generated maze. It is a two player game (Though in future, more players may be added) where each player can only see in one cartesian direction. Each maze is represented by a 2D array of cells, where each cell can be of type wall, air, entrance, or exit. Both players control one character, who takes up one cell of the maze. Player one can only see the cells in the row that the character is in, while player Two can only see the cells in the column. Additionally, player 1 can only move left and right, while player two can only move up and down. As players move, the rows and columns shift, so that both players can see correctly according to where the character is. The players should not be able to see each other's game. As a result, they are required to communicate with each other to navigate and escape the maze." },
